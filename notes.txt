index and collection difference

index - named container of vectors
can query an index

collection - static copy of an index

useful to backup an index

distance metrics - how to calculate the shortest distance
1. 
Euclidean - shortest distance between 2 vectors
values = 0 to infinity

2. 
cosine - Angular distance
normalized = values are from -1 to 1

3.
dot product
Not normalized, more positive means more closer
